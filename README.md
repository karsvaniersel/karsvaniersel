### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kars van Iersel and I'm a **Full Stack Developer** at [Springbok Agency](https://springbokagency.com) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. My areas of expertise encompass the entire development cycle: from idea generation, idea visualization, creating and setting up architecture, creating a development workflow, UI/UX, and finally programming rich **webapps** and **websites**.

Most of the time I work with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), but the past year I've also been working with creating and maintaining web components using [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/docs/component).
