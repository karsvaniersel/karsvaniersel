### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kars van Iersel and I'm a Software Engineer from The Netherlands. My areas of expertise encompass the entire development cycle: from idea generation, idea visualization, creating and setting up architecture, creating a development workflow, UI/UX, and finally programming rich **webapps** and **websites**.

Most of the time I work with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) combined with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) using [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)
